# This is the alx-files_manager project folder!

#### This project is a summary of the following back-end trimester:
	authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

### The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files.

#### It has the following features:
	User authentication via a token
	List all files
	Upload a new file
	Change permission of a file
	View a file
	Generate thumbnails for images

### We will be guided step by step for building it, but we have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be our friend)

### Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.
